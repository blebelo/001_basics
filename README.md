# Python Basics Exercise

This exercise is designed to help you practice and reinforce your understanding of Python's basics, including syntax, variables, data types, basic operations, and control flow statements.

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Python script file `main.py`.
3. Implement the functions provided in the skeleton with their respective problem statements.
4. Test your implementations by calling the functions with different inputs in the script or in a separate Python file.
5. Once you have completed all the functions and get the tests to pass, feel free to add any additional tests or improvements.
6. Share your solutions with others or discuss them in Python communities to get feedback and learn from others' approaches.

## Function Descriptions

Each function in `main.py` is associated with a specific problem statement related to Python basics. Here's a brief overview of each function:

1. `add_two_numbers(a, b)`: Returns the sum of two numbers.
2. `multiply_list_elements(lst)`: Returns the result of multiplying all elements in a list.
3. `check_even_or_odd(num)`: Checks if a number is even or odd.
4. `find_max_in_list(lst)`: Finds the maximum number in a list.
5. `calculate_factorial(n)`: Calculates the factorial of a number.
6. `reverse_string(string)`: Reverses a given string.
7. `count_vowels(string)`: Counts the number of vowels in a string.
8. `check_palindrome(string)`: Checks if a string is a palindrome.
9. `generate_fibonacci_sequence(n)`: Generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
10. `check_prime_number(num)`: Checks if a number is prime.
